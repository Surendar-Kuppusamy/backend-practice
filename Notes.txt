Git Sync up Process:
----------------------

*) Then, sync your git respository via "Add Remote" on source control.
*) Checkout to master branch.
*) Create new branch via command "git branch create-node-modules-package"
*) Checkout to the new branch via command "git checkout create-node-modules-package"
*) Publish the branch.
*) Then start work now,

Process:
--------
*) Create project via command, "npm init"
*) It will ask project details and git respository
*) Create index file and update you code.
*) Finally, run command "npm link", it make your code available globally.
*) Run command "npm link [package-name]" to install your package on node_modules folder.

Important Notes:
-----------------
*) Don't use "npm link", it is not secure approach.
*) Instead run command "npm pack", it will automatically creates one file with "[package-name]-[verion].tgz".
*) Then, copy the file and paste that file on which project you want to use this library.
